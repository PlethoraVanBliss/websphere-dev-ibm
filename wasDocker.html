    <title>WAS with Docker</title>
</head>
<body>
<p class="ibm-small" dir="ltr">
    Let&#39;s run IBM WebSphere Application Server(WAS) for Developers in a Docker Container. The idea here in this post is to create and <br/>
    save a docker container with WebSphere installed so you can reuse the container whenever you need to run a new WAS in development. <br/>
    Please check the licensing requirements to run WebSphere at the download page. The steps here should be easily ported and reproduced <br/>
    to create an image of WebSphere N.D full profile as well if you want.</p>
<p class="ibm-small" dir="ltr">
    I will run this steps in a Linux Fedora 20 distribuition but it should be easily ported to other O.Ss.</p>
<p class="ibm-small" dir="ltr">
    I will use and run a local image that already has <a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/devTips/entry/ibm_installation_manager_in_silent_mode_no_x_on_linux_quick_reference?lang=en" target="_blank">Installation&nbsp;Manager&nbsp;installed&nbsp;as&nbsp;the&nbsp;base&nbsp;initial&nbsp;image</a>, <br/>
    this image was created from a CentOS image from the public Docker repository. You may want to run your container in a supported linux <br/>
    version. To do that you will need to create your own Red Hat, Suze or other supported O.S image as it requires a license to use and  <br/>
    won&#39;t be available at the Docker public repository.</p>
<p class="ibm-small" dir="ltr">
    To follow the steps in this post you will need the following software:</p>
<p class="ibm-small" dir="ltr">
    <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/downloads/ws/wasdevelopers/" target="_blank">Latest&nbsp;IBM&nbsp;WebSphere&nbsp;Application&nbsp;Server&nbsp;for&nbsp;Developers. </a>-&nbsp; Currently the latest version is 8.5.5(3 parts) and I am running it using Java 7(3 parts) so you will need to download all files that compose WebSphere + JDK 7 as shown below:</p>
<p class="ibm-small" dir="ltr">
    <a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/devTips/resource/BLOGS_UPLOADED_IMAGES/WAS8.5.5Dev_JDK7_files.png" style="width: 100%; display: inline-block;" target="_blank"><img alt="image" src="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/devTips/resource/BLOGS_UPLOADED_IMAGES/WAS8.5.5Dev_JDK7_files.png" style="  display:block; margin: 0 auto;text-align: center;" /></a></p>
<p class="ibm-small" dir="ltr">
    Latest IBM Installation Manager - Currently the latest version is 1.8 as shown below</p>
<p class="ibm-small" dir="ltr">
    &nbsp;</p>
<p class="ibm-small" dir="ltr">
    <a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/devTips/resource/BLOGS_UPLOADED_IMAGES/IM_8_linux_dowload.png" style="width: 100%; display: inline-block;" target="_blank"><img alt="image" src="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/devTips/resource/BLOGS_UPLOADED_IMAGES/IM_8_linux_dowload.png" style="  display:block; margin: 0 auto;text-align: center;" /></a></p>
<p class="ibm-small" dir="ltr">
    &nbsp;</p>
<p class="ibm-small" dir="ltr">
    Once you downloaded all files create a folder at your prefered workspace location to host the Dockerfile and all downloaded and required files and resources needed to install WebSphere.</p>
<p class="ibm-small" dir="ltr">
    The WebSphere container image can&#39;t be made available at the docker public repository as Websphere is not Open Source of free software,<br />
    but you can share the image at a local registry internally at your company if the company has WebSphere licensed.</p>
